## Hey, I'm Prathvin

Frontend engineer who enjoys building **fast, scalable UIs** and fixing the kind of performance issues most people prefer to ignore.

I mostly work with **React + TypeScript**, care a lot about **architecture**, and like turning messy frontend codebases into something boring and predictable (the good kind).

---

### Stuff I’m good at
- React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Performance optimization (large datasets, rendering, bundles)
- Micro Frontends (Module Federation)
- AG Grid (server-side, 1M+ rows)
- Auth flows (JWT, cookies, role-based access)
- API-driven frontend (Node.js / Express for integration)

---

### Things I’ve built
- **Create MFE Kit** – a CLI to scaffold Micro Frontend setups without boilerplate pain  
- **Player Auction System** – live auction app with organizers, teams, and viewers  
- **Astronaut Survival Game** – browser game with modular scenes and smooth rendering

### Currently messing around with
- Advanced frontend performance patterns  
- Micro Frontend state sharing strategies  
- JavaScript internals (parsers, runtimes, engines — purely out of curiosity)
