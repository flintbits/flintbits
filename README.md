## Hey, I'm Prathvin

Frontend engineer who enjoys building **fast, scalable UIs** and fixing the kind of performance issues most people prefer to ignore.

I mostly work with **React + TypeScript**, and like turning messy frontend codebases into something boring and predictable (the good kind).

# Currently Building (Active Project)

### Player Auction System (Live Bidding Platform)

A real-time auction platform where **Organizers manage auctions**, **Team Admins bid live**, and **viewers join without login**.

- Organizer creates rooms, configures rules, manages player pool  
- Team Admins apply to join rooms and bid in real-time  
- Viewers join using Room Code + Password (view-only)  
- Real-time updates via WebSockets (bids, teams, player selection, results)  
- RBAC enforced using JWT + role-based permissions
